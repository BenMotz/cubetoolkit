Cube Toolkit
============

Introduction
------------

This is the code that powers parts of the Cube Microplex, a volunteer run
thing in Bristol, UK: http://www.cubecinema.com/

It's a Django (i.e. Python) application that (currently) provides an event
diary and membership database.

It was initially written to closely emulate a set of Perl CGI scripts, which
is why the UI is the way it is.

Installation
------------
This is very much the code for the Cube's purposes, as such no great effort
has been made to make it easy to install elsewhere. The doc/ directory has
some documentation for Cube volunteers who want to get the development version
up and running, in order to work on it themselves.
