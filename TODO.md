1. When an event is being made live, if it has the 'meeting' tag, do not require users to fill out the terms field
2. Review the error message for other times the terms field is empty.
3. Update the site build tests for the logic branch
4. Delete this content/file before merging this branch to master!

Optionally:
- Automatically put in "N/A" or "Meeting", etc to the terms.
- Grey out the terms field if the 'meeting' tag is added. Un-grey when removed.
