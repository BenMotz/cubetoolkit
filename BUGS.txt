[NEWFEATURE] -- Per-tag RSS
[NEWFEATURE] -- 'subscribe me' UI for members lists
[NEWFEATURE] --  make old IDs work into the future
[TODO] -- Basic member automated tests
[TODO] -- 'days ahead' on edit view should be persistent preference
[TODO] -- result count in member search?
[TODO] -- do JS close of popup using a redirect?

[BUG] -- make more forms redirect after submit, to avoid reload adding duplicates (eg. new member form)
[BUG] -- If diary view-by-tag has nothing then have an informative message! (Likewise by date?)
[BUG] -- handle errors for saving Event details if image and image is missing

[WONTFIX] -- WYSIWYG HTML editor isn't quite right ...
[DONE] -- Illegal form values should be in *RED* (in showing/booking edit, plus other places?)
[DONE] -- internal notes for events - fewer lines, nearer top of form
[FIXED] -- "Ttt" in imported title data
[FIXED] -- closing popups doesn't work before pref is changed?
[DONE] -- Cancel buttons everywhere
[DONE] -- Public pages should be under /programme/, private under /diary
[DONE] -- Need a sensible archive view/search
[DONE] -- Less busy role selection in new vol screen. Use precendence?
[FIXED] -- Add anchors to diary view so jumping by legacy id will work
[FIXED] -- html links shouldn't be rel="nofollow"/target blank
[FIXED] -- auth bug highlighted by tests
[FIXED] -- Allow shorter event names (whoops)
[FIXED] -- don't allow all blank event names / booked_by
[FIXED] -- On import of members, detect "not member" in status field and set a boolean to signify the same.
[FIXED] HTML editor looks shonky
[CANTREPRODUCE] Popup date/time picker not working on "Edit booking" form after failed submission
[FIXED] -- Need to set allowed hosts
[FIXED] -- Sort out logging configuration to be sane (or at least less insane)
[FIXED] Creating an event for TODAY (generic "new event" link) defaults to RIGHT NOW if it's after 8pm, complete with whack number of seconds
[FIXED] Terms report search is wonky (doesn't search event names?)
[FIXED] Add better help text to top of "Roles" edit
[FIXED] Add 'messages' display to top of Event templates edit (and Roles/Tags edit?)
[FIXED] Add 'this cannot be undone' to 'Delete showing' prompt
[FIXED] Editing event details:
 1. Set name to blank, save (fails)
 2. Set photo caption blank, save:
